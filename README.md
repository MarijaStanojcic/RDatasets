# RDatasets
Find r data from a website list of data sets 

Motivation: I wanted to find R dataset to work with for my class project. I found this website of a lot of r datasets http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html and rather than looking through each data independently I decided to make a program that would help me find my data.

This program reads the list of data sets from the website into one data. Checks for uninstalled packages and installs them. Checks for unloaded packages and loads them, and all of this make it possible to easily search for a particular R data (from the website) with some specifics, for example, number of rows, number of columns, etc.
